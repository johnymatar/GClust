GClust performs nucleotides sequences clustering using GMM

usage: gclust -in [input fasta file] -out [output fasta file] -alignMode [alignment mode] -mdist [scoring matrix]

Available scoring matrices are EDNAFULL, BLOSUM62, and PAM250. Defaults to EDNAFULL if not specified.
Available alignment modes are: fast, moderate, maxPrecision. fast and moderate limit the number of iterations for the alignment to 2 and 4 respectively (using MUSCLE). Defaults to maxPrecision if not specified.

Note: parameters are case sensitive, e.g. using -alignmode instead of -alignMode will cause this parameter to be disregarded, and using blosum62 instead of BLOSUM62 will be mentioned as an error.
